Project Description:
During my internship at CodTech IT Private Limited, I worked on a Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension, a lightweight full-stack browser extension designed to help users manage tasks and track time efficiently. The extension enables users to add tasks, start and stop timers for each task, and monitor the total time spent, with all data stored persistently in Chrome’s storage.

The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple and interactive popup interface for task management and real-time time tracking. The backend logic is implemented using JavaScript within the Chrome extension environment, managing timers, task storage, and updates efficiently.

The project emphasizes browser extension development, task management functionality, and time-tracking logic, allowing users to monitor their productivity directly from the browser without requiring a separate application.

This internship helped me enhance my skills in JavaScript, Chrome extension development, and real-time task tracking, while gaining hands-on experience in creating interactive, data-driven extensions. The project also demonstrates the ability to follow best coding practices, implement functional features within a browser environment, and deliver a working solution within the one-month internship duration.
